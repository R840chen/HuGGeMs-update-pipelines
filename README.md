# HuGGeMs-update-pipeline

**A pipeline to update the Human Gut Microbial Genetic Markers (HuGGeMs) database**

---

## Overview

`HuGGeMs-update-pipeline` is a collection of scripts and workflows designed to update the Human Gut Microbial Genetic Markers (HuGGeMs) database. The pipeline has two main parts:

1. **Presence detection (Part I)** — determine whether a provided genome/species is already represented in the HuGGeMs dataset, using genome distance comparisons (dRep).
2. **Marker-gene selection & update (Part II)** — predict genes from input genomes, annotate them (UniRef90/50), identify core genes and select marker genes to update the HuGGeMs dataset.

Each part contains one or more scripts. Part I contains a script that computes genome distances against the HuGGeMs representative cluster genomes using `dRep`. Part II is a higher-level workflow assembled from multiple scripts (11 small components) handling gene prediction, annotation, core gene identification and marker-gene selection.

## Datasets Required

You will need the following datasets (place paths or download instructions in `docs/` or an `examples/` folder):

* **HuGGeMs representative clusters (11,167 genomes)** — used by Part I to decide whether a query genome/species is already included. (Provide download path or link in `docs/`.)
* **UniRef90 and UniRef50 databases** — used to annotate predicted proteins in Part II.
* **HuGGeMs dataset (marker profiles / reference)** — used to profile species composition and relative abundance of metagenomes and to update the HuGGeMs marker set.

> **Note:** Replace the placeholder `xxx` with the real download URLs or local paths in `docs/DATASETS.md`.

## Software Dependencies

### Part I (Presence detection)

* `dRep` (compare mode)
* Optional / recommended: `mash`, `mummer` (nucmer), `fastANI`, `centrifuge`

Suggested install commands:

```bash
pip install drep
conda install -c bioconda mash mummer fastani centrifuge -y
```

### Part II (Marker-gene selection & update)

* `prokka`
* `diamond`
* `mmseqs2`
* `art_illumina` (or `art`)
* `bowtie2`
* `samtools`
* `bamutil`
* `biopython`

Suggested install command:

```bash
conda create -n gmb-update -c bioconda prokka diamond mmseqs2 art bowtie2 samtools bamutil biopython -y
conda activate gmb-update
```

> **Important:** The integrated script for Part II assumes all required tools are available within a single conda environment. If you cannot install all tools in one environment, run the component scripts separately in suitable environments as documented in `docs/COMPONENT_USAGE.md`.

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/GMB-update-pipeline.git
cd GMB-update-pipeline
```

2. Prepare datasets (see `docs/DATASETS.md`) and ensure required software is installed and on your `PATH`.

3. (Optional) Create the recommended conda environment for Part II:

```bash
conda env create -f envs/HuGGeMs-update.yml   # if provided
conda activate HuGGeMs-update
```

---

## Usage

### Part I — Presence detection

This part checks whether provided genomes or species are already represented in HuGGeMs.

**Example:**

```bash
# run the presence-detection script (example)
python part1_presence_detection/check_presence.py \
  --input-genomes /path/to/query_genomes/ \
  --gmb-rep-genomes /path/to/11167_representatives.txt \
  --out results/presence_report.tsv
```

**What it does:**

* Computes genome distances against the GMB representative genomes using `dRep`.
* Outputs a tabular report listing whether each query genome is represented, with distance/ANI values.

### Part II — Marker-gene selection & update

This part performs gene prediction, annotation, core-gene detection and marker selection to update the HuGGeMs marker set.

**High-level example (integrated workflow):**

```bash
# run the integrated Part II workflow (example)
python part2_marker_selection/run_pipeline.py \
  --input-genomes /path/to/genomes/ \
  --uniref90 /path/to/uniref90.fasta \
  --uniref50 /path/to/uniref50.fasta \
  --gmb-reference /path/to/gmb_reference/ \
  --outdir results/part2_output
```

**If tools are installed in different environments:**

* Use the separated component scripts in `part2_marker_selection/components/` and follow `docs/COMPONENT_USAGE.md` to run each step sequentially.

## Notes and Recommendations

* Provide absolute paths for input/output arguments to avoid ambiguity.
* Use the recommended conda environment to ensure reproducible behavior.
* Large databases (UniRef, representative genomes) may be large; make sure you have sufficient disk space.
* Where possible, run compute-intensive steps (e.g., annotation, all-vs-all comparisons) on a cluster or machine with multiple cores.
